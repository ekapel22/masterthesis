    "NPO Start is a service that offers users the ability to watch video content on demand. This video content is displayed to users in so-called \"ribbons\" or rows that have a certain theme, like 'Populair', 'Nieuw' and 'Aanbevolen voor jou'. Each ribbon consists out of a ranked list of several items. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users of the service who have an account have the ability to receive several personalized ribbons which contain items that are recommended for a specific user. These recommendations are materialized on the front page of the service in the ribbon called 'Aanbevolen voor jou'. This ribbon utilizes the history of user interactions with items to perform collaborative filtering. These user interactions are grouped on series level and evaluated by pairs of series which are frequently watched together, or coincide often, with the history of the user. Of these coincidences, the top 100 pairs are extracted which are ordered based on their frequency, which results in a personalized ribbon of items for a single user. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a lot of metadata available about the offered content which is unused by the current recommendation system. In this thesis, the metadata of broadcasts will be utilised in a hybrid recommendation system to determine if it can improve the performance of the current video recommendation system."

    "\n",
    "* __Precision@k__\n",
    "Precision@k is a metric that evaluates the proportion of top-k recommended items that are relevant to the user. A relevant item is an item that was chosen by a user when it was offered in a ribbon. Relevant items are denoted as a true positive (TP) which are positive predicted values. Precision is then given as the total number of predicted positives out of all predicted items.\n",

    "\n",
    "* __AP__\n",
    "AP evaluates the quality and rank of the recommended items. This metric is lower when positive predicted values do not appear at the top of the item list. It assesses the precision at each rank and divides it by the total amount of TPs.\n",

    "AP = \\frac{1}{TP}\\sum_{k=1}^m\\frac{|\\{i \\in TP\\mid i\\mbox{ ranked in top k}\\}|}{k}\n",

    "The AP over all the users is given by the MAP (mean average precision), where for each recommendation the corresponding AP is calculated and the mean is taken out of all the scores. This metric then shows how good the model is at performing the recommendations. R is the number of recommendations in the set and AP(r) is the average precision for a given recommendation, r. \n",
    "Q is the number of queries in the set and AveP(q) is the average precision (AP) for a given query, q.\n",

    "#### Experimental setup\n",
    "A hybrid recommendation system using the Python library LightFM was set up which is a hybrid matrix factorisation model which represents users and items as linear combinations of their content featuresâ€™ latent factors. A weighted approximate-rank pairwise loss was used which learns to rank the items. The model learns user and item representations from the input data, by using the latent representation approach. It computes recommendations for new items and users, by representing items and users as linear combinations of their content features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps taken in implementing the LightFM model are:\n",
    "1. Loading and cleaning the user interaction data\n",
    "    1. removing duplicates and thresholding (making sure users have liked at least 5 items, and items are liked by at least 5 users)\n",
    "2. Preparing content feature vectors\n",
    "    2. one-hot-encoding the content features\n",
    "3. Transforming the user interaction data into an interactions matrix\n",
    "4. Preparing a 5-fold cross-validation \n",
    "5. Executing the model\n",
    "6. Optimizing the hyperparameters \n",
    "    6. using the library scikit-optimize on the parameters epoch, learning rate, number of components and alpha\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of this model is assessed in an offline setting on historical user interaction data from the month March. Different versions of the model that incoorporate different content features are tested to assess the precision of recommendations. For now the precision@k of six different versions has been tested, which consists out of a baseline model that only employs MF, and six others that employ either one content feature that has or hasn't been pre-processed or several content features.

    "The results indicate that the highest precision was achieved by the model that used no content features, so which only used matrix factorization. The lowest precision was gained when the content features broadcaster and title were incoorporated into the hybrid recommendation model. Both the hybrid models that only had one content feature had a precision around the 0,15 and all the versions have about the same standard deviation. This shows that incooporating content features into the model did not help the precision of recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "One possible explanation for the lower achieved precision for the models with content features is the drawback of offline experiments. Offline experiments assume that members would have behaved the same, e.g. playing the same videos, if the new model being evaluated was used to generate the recommendations (Gomez, 2015). Thus the new models that produce different recommendations from the current NPO recommendation system are unlikely to find that their recommendations are chosen more than the actual offered recommendations. Since the user interaction data is biased towards the current recommendation system, it may affect the produced precision in an offline environment. "
